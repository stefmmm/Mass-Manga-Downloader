## Mass Manga Downloader (MMD)
#### Getting Started
##### 1. Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

##### 3. Make sure you got a file ready with links/id's to download.

### Stuff to note:
##### Reader is unsurprisingly borked, certain special characters break things

### Module's
##### Now i'm gonna be honest this definitely needs refining..
##### 1. The pururin module expects a json file containing gallery urls
##### 2. The hentaiser module expects a txt file containing the book id's
##### More Module's Soonâ„¢ (just request one and i'll get to it one day)
